\section{Risk Analysis and Security Measures}

\subsection{Assets}

Describe the relevant assets and their required security
  properties. For example, data objects, access restrictions,
  configurations, etc.

\subsection{Threat Sources}

Name and describe potential threat sources including their motivation.

\subsection{Risks and Countermeasures}

List all potential threats and the
  corresponding countermeasures. Estimate the risk based on 
  the information about the threat, the threat sources and the 
  corresponding countermeasure. For this purpose, use the following three
  tables.

%\subsubsection{Tools}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Impact} \\
\hline
Impact & Description \\
\hline
\hline
High & Complete shutdown of the system, \\
     & user data is compromised, \\
     & apocalypse and a major loss in asset value,\\
     & complete loss of the customers confidence, \\
     
\hline
Medium & system slow down\\
	   & loss in asset value \\
\hline
Low   & relatively affect the credibility of the company,\\
& lower the customers confidence and a relative loss in asset value\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Likelihood} \\
\hline
Likelihood & Description \\
\hline
\hline
High   &  the threat source has the power to exploit vulnerabilities in the system,\\
& the countermeasures are inexistant or ineffective \\
\hline
Medium & the threat source is motivated, \\
& some countermeasures are implemented which may prevent him to do harm \\
\hline
Low   & the countermeasures are completely effective,(almost) nothing to worry about \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{{\bf Risk Level}} \\
\hline
{{\bf Likelihood}} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{{\bf Impact}} \\ %\cline{2-4}
     & Low & Medium & High \\  \hline
 High & Low & Medium & High  \\
\hline
 Medium & Low & Medium & Medium \\
\hline
 Low & Low & Low & Low \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{{\it Evaluation Asset X}}

Evaluate the likelihood, impact and the resulting risk,  after implementation of the corresponding countermeasures. For each threat, clearly name the threat source and the the threat action.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{lXp{3.5cm}lll}
No. & Threat & Implemented /planned countermeasure(s) & L & I & Risk \\
\hline
1 & release of personal information  &  using hash and salted password & {\it Low} & {\it Low} & {\it Low} \\
\hline
2 & ... & ...& {\it Medium} & {\it High} & {\it Medium} \\
\hline
\end{prettytablex}
\end{footnotesize}



\subsubsection{{\it Evaluation Asset y}}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{lXp{6.5cm}lll}
No. & Threat & Implemented/planned countermeasure(s) & L & I & Risk \\
\hline
1 & ... & ... & {\it Low} & {\it Low} & {\it Low} \\
\hline
2 & ... & ...& {\it Medium} & {\it High} & {\it Medium} \\
\hline
\end{prettytablex}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsubsection{Detailed Description of Selected Countermeasures}

Optionally explain the details of the countermeasures mentioned above.



\subsubsection{Risk Acceptance}

List all medium and high risks, according to the evaluation above. For each risk, propose additional countermeasures that could be implemented to further reduce the risks.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{p{2cm}X}
No. of threat & Proposed countermeasure including expected impact  \\
\hline
x & Allowing users only 3 login attempts \\
\hline
y & using one time password sent by sms \\
\hline
\end{prettytablex}
