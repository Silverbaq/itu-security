\section{System Characterization}

\subsection{System Overview}

Describe the system's mission,  the system boundaries,
and the overall system architecture, including the main subsystems and
their relationships.   This description should provide a high-level
overview of the system, e.g., suitable for managers, that complements
the more technical description that follows.Hi this is a report



\subsection{System Functionality}

As described in the project description, the system implements the main requirements, namely:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the system should allow the user to upload pictures 
\item the user can share his own pictures with other named users on a picture-by-picture basis
\item the user can view his own pictures and pictures other has shared with him
\item the user can comment on any picture he can view
\item and the user can view comments on any picture he can view  
\end{enumerate}


    

\subsection{Components and Subsystems}
The system is based on the Flask micro framework which is written in Python. Flask is using Jinja to generate html which is sanitizing the fields that comes from the outside world. 
(List all system components, subdivided, for example, into
  categories such as platforms, applications, data records, etc. For
  each component, state its relevant properties.)


\subsection{Interfaces}

Specify  all interfaces and  information flows, from the technical as well as from the
  organizational point of view.

\subsection{Backdoors}

Describe the implemented backdoors. {\bfseries Do not add
    this section to the version of your report that is handed over to
    the team that reviews your system!}

\subsection{Additional Material}

You may have additional sections according to your needs.


\section{Risk Analysis and Security Measures}

\subsection{Assets}

Describe the relevant assets and their required security
  properties. For example, data objects, access restrictions,
  configurations, etc.

\subsection{Threat Sources}

\begin{enumerate}


\item \textit{Employees} : the only employee in our tiny company consist of a system administrator (Steffen) who has access to the server,he could possibly leak sensitive information intentionally or unintentionally.
\item \textit{Hackers} : since the system is connected to internet,it is exposed to various attacks,the attackers vary from highly motivated people with good skills actively trying to penetrate the system to script kidies just messing around.
\item \textit{Malware} : as any it system, malware could possibly be a problem, it could be directed malware (unlikely) or undirected malware (more likely).
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Risks and Countermeasures}

List all potential threats and the
  corresponding countermeasures. Estimate the risk based on 
  the information about the threat, the threat sources and the 
  corresponding countermeasure. For this purpose, use the following three
  tables.

%\subsubsection{Tools}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Impact} \\
\hline
Impact & Description \\
\hline
\hline
High & Complete shutdown of the system, \\
     & user data is compromised \\
     & apocalypse and a major loss in asset value\\
     & complete loss of the customers confidence \\
     
         
\hline
Medium & High response time \\
	   & loss in asset value \\	
\hline
Low   & relatively affect the credibility of the company,\\
	  & lower the customers confidence and a relative loss in asset value\\
\hline

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Likelihood} \\
\hline
Likelihood & Description \\
\hline
\hline
High   & the threat source has the power to exploit vulnerabilities in the system,\\
	   & the countermeasures are inexistant or ineffective \\
\hline
Medium & the threat source is motivated,\\
& some countermeasures are implemented which may prevent them to do harm  \\
\hline
Low   & the countermeasures are completely effective,\\
&(almost) nothing to worry about  \\

\end{center}

\end{center}

\subsubsection{{\it Evaluation Asset X}}

Evaluate the likelihood, impact and the resulting risk,  after implementation of the corresponding countermeasures. For each threat, clearly name the threat source and the the threat action.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{lXp{3.5cm}lll}
No. & Threat & Implemented /planned countermeasure(s) & L & I & Risk \\
\hline
1 & release of personal information  &  using hash and salted password & {\it Low} & {\it Low} & {\it Low} \\
\hline
2 & ... & ...& {\it Medium} & {\it High} & {\it Medium} \\
\hline
\end{prettytablex}
\end{footnotesize}



\subsubsection{{\it Evaluation Asset y}}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{lXp{6.5cm}lll}
No. & Threat & Implemented/planned countermeasure(s) & L & I & Risk \\
\hline
1 & ... & ... & {\it Low} & {\it Low} & {\it Low} \\
\hline
2 & ... & ...& {\it Medium} & {\it High} & {\it Medium} \\
\hline
\end{prettytablex}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsubsection{Detailed Description of Selected Countermeasures}

Optionally explain the details of the countermeasures mentioned above.



\subsubsection{Risk Acceptance}

List all medium and high risks, according to the evaluation above. For each risk, propose additional countermeasures that could be implemented to further reduce the risks.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{p{2cm}X}
No. of threat & Proposed countermeasure including expected impact  \\
\hline
x & Allowing users only 3 attempts \\
\hline
... & ... \\
\hline
