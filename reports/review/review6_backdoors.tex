\subsection{Backdoors}

If defining a backdoor as a way to gain root access to the system. Then we didn't manage to exploit any. \\
One thing we do know, is that the server is running "WildFly", and that comes with a webinterface, that will give you access to a terminal to the system. This is of course proteced with  authentication. We have tryed an attempt to break this, with the top 500 most used password, and the username admin - But with no luck.
